I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Oregon State University, where I am advised by the wonderful [Dr. Amir Nayyeri](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~nayyeria/). I previously completed my MS in Computer Science at Oregon State University and my BS in Computer Science and Mathematics at Montana State University.
