Beginning Fall 2024, I will be an EnCORE Postdoctoral Fellow at University of California San Diego, where I will be advised by [Dr. Yusu Wang](http://yusu.belkin-wang.org/) and [Dr. Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/). I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Oregon State University, where I had the fortune to be advised by [Dr. Amir Nayyeri](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~nayyeria/). I also completed my MS in Computer Science at Oregon State University and my BS in Computer Science and Mathematics at Montana State University.
